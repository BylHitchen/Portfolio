Hello! I’m Bill. While my full name might be a bit of a mouthful (yes it has no vowels) , feel free to call me Bill. I’m an aspiring data analyst dedicated to solving real-world problems through data analytics. Although I’m just starting my journey, i do have over 20 years of IT experience in the banking and outsourcing sector and very eager to pivot my knowledge and growth in the world of data.

I’m committed to advancing my skills and becoming proficient in data analysis. I invite you to follow my progress and stay tuned for updates. If you’d like to learn more about me, click on my profile picture to visit my LinkedIn page. Thank you for your time and support!

# Projects
As I’m currently diving into the world of data analysis through Coursera courses, you’ll primarily see a collection of foundational projects. These projects are a great way for me to apply what I'm learning in a structured environment.

But fear not! As I continue to build my knowledge and skills, I'll be embarking on my own projects, showcasing more advanced work in due time.
